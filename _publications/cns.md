title: "Transferability of Adversarial Examples in Machine Learning-based Malware Detection"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/cns
excerpt: 'This paper improves the transferability of adversarial examples (AEs) so that the generated AEs can evade multiple types of ML-based malware detector. We study AE transferability enhancement techniques (i.e., ensemble sample (ES) and ensemble model (EM)) and how they impact AE generation and Android malware detection. Further, we develop a new transfer-based AE generation method, BATE, using a novel feature evenness metric. 
The idea is to spread perturbations more evenly among perturbed features by incorporating an evenness score in the objective function. '
