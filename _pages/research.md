My research lies at the intersection between **computer security, networking, and AI**. In todayâ€™s data-driven and universally connected cyber landscape, the three critical research areas are inseparable, each continuously advancing and shaping the others. My work focuses on uncovering previously unexplored vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art networking and AI systems from a red-team perspective, and subsequently proposing effective defense mechanisms to strengthen their security and resilience.

Here are a few selected projects from my PhD research.

[**Model Inversion Attacks against Secure Federated Learning Systems**](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/FL-Privacy/)

[**Building Trustworthy and Verifiable Spectrum Sharing Systems**](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/SAS-Security/)

[**Protecting Network Timing from Byzantine Attacks within Time-Sensitive IoT Networks**](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/IoT-Security/)

Beyond these areas, I am also interested in a range of network and information security topics such as Blockchain, autonomous vehicle security, FL model poisoning attacks, model fingerprinting, and intrusion detection systems.
