My research interests focus on the intersection area between **computer security, networking, and AI**. In todayâ€™s data-driven and universally connected cyber world, I believe the three important research topics are indivisible and advancing and shaping the other. My Ph.D. research features three themes, starting from IoT network security problems to machine learning security and privacy problems.

[Model Inversion Attacks against Secure Federated Learning Systems](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/FL-Privacy/)

[Building Trustworthy and Verifiable Spectrum Sharing Systems](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/SAS-Security/)

[Protecting Network Timing from Byzantine Attacks within Time-Sensitive IoT Networks](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/IoT-Security/)

Aside from these works, I also have broad research interests in other network and information security topics such as Blockchain, autonomous vehicle security, FL model poisoning attacks, model fingerprinting, and intrusion detection systems.
