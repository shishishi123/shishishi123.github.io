My research focuses on the intersection between **computer security, networking, and AI**. In todayâ€™s data-driven and universally connected cyber world, the three critical research areas are inseparable, each continuously advancing and shaping the others. 

Here are a few selected projects during my PhD study.

[Model Inversion Attacks against Secure Federated Learning Systems](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/FL-Privacy/)

[Building Trustworthy and Verifiable Spectrum Sharing Systems](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/SAS-Security/)

[Protecting Network Timing from Byzantine Attacks within Time-Sensitive IoT Networks](https://shishishi123.github.io/research/IoT-Security/)

Aside from these works, I am also interested in other network and information security topics such as Blockchain, autonomous vehicle security, FL model poisoning attacks, model fingerprinting, and intrusion detection systems.
