I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech. My research area is **network security and privacy**. I am particularly interested in the topics related to wireless security, CPS and IoT security, and machine learning security and privacy.

## Education
* B.S. in Communications Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, 2015-2019
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Virginia Tech, 2019-now
