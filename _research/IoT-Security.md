## Research Problem
- Ensuring *network time synchronization* is super important for time-sensitive IoT networks such as 5G and automotive Ethernet because they have very stringent time synchronization requirements and failing to meet them (even for a millisecond-level desynchronization) can cause significant system performance degradation. 
- Technically, *precision time protocol (PTP)* is the widely-used network timing protocol that ensures time synchronization for many distributed networks.

- In this research, we first propose a powerful insider time shifting attack launched by a malicious PTP client that is able to gradually shift the system time of an arbitrarily chosen victim node, even when the network is protected by the existing authentication mechanisms.

- As a countermeasure, we propose a multi-source time synchronization mechanism named MS-PTP that aggregates the timing measurements of multiple sources. We devise a Byzantine resilient aggregation mechanism, which can defend Byzantine timing attacks when less than one-third of the sources are affected and overcomes unavoidable benign noise during the timing measurement process.
- We provide a mathematical guarantee for the maximum error of our mechanism and validate the effectiveness of our mechanism on hardware testbeds.

## Results
- We verify the consequence of our attack on a real Turtlebot robotic platform demonstrating that the robots will go to the wrong trajectories when the attack is launched.

- We implement our defense mechanism on our PTP harware testbed and the results show that our proposed defense can effectively defense various timing attacks.
- Our mechanism is compatible with the current indistrial PTP standard.
